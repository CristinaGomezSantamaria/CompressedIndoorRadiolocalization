# CompressedIndoorRadiolocalization
Different codes were implemented in order to perform compressed sensing radiolocalization in indoors.
Just execute the main, JDCS. This is an implementation of the Joint Distributed Compressed Sensing algorithm based on the proposal by % "Localization in wireless networks based on jointly compressed sensing" % by S. Nikitaki, P. Tsakalides. IEEE EUSIPCO, 2011.
The simulator implemented creates a synthetic grid of points in a rectangular area, in order to build a dictionary of RSSI signals in each position of the grid. With this dictionary, the CS paradigm is applied for dimensionality reduction.
